# Practical Lab 3 â€“ Vanilla CNN and Fine-Tuned VGG16 for Dogs vs Cats Classification

This lab demonstrates how to build and evaluate two deep learning models to classify dog and cat images:

- A **Vanilla CNN** (custom convolutional neural network from scratch)
- A **Fine-Tuned VGG16** model (transfer learning with ImageNet weights)

---

## Dataset

- **Dataset** used: [Dogs vs Cats Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/biaiscience/dogs-vs-cats)
- A subset of **5000 images** (2000 train, 1000 validation, 2000 test) was used for training and evaluation.
- Images were pre-split using a custom Python script.

---

##  Models

### 1. Vanilla CNN
- 3 Convolutional Layers
- Trained from scratch
- Overfitting observed after Epoch 5

### 2. Fine-Tuned VGG16
- Transfer learning with frozen convolutional base
- Custom dense head
- Achieved ~**89%** accuracy on test data
- Better generalization and performance than Vanilla CNN

---

##  Evaluation Metrics

Both models were compared using:

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Precision-Recall Curves
- Visualization of misclassifications
- Side-by-side predictions on random test images
